# PDFSummariser
This is a simple tool to allow you to batch extract comments from PDF files contained in a folder and its subfolders, it makes use of the iText library to process the PDF files, the remaining code uses .Net.

Feel free to fork for your own purposes, any refinements will be considered for inclusion into this project, I have very little free time to add more myself but will update as the project progresses.
